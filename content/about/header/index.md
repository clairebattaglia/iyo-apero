I'm a data analyst focused on food system change. This is where I share what I'm working on as I untangle the complexities of our food system and how we can move towards one that is more healthful, equitable, and sustainable.

When I'm not lost in a project, I can be found trail running, climbing peaks, or playing on the river with my husband and our very enthusiastic German Wirehaired Pointer.
