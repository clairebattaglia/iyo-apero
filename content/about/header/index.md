I'm a data analyst focused on food system change. This is where I share what I'm working on as I untangle the complexities of our food system and how to create change.

When I'm not lost in a project, I can be found trail running, backpacking, paddle boarding---just generally playing around outside with my husband and our... *energetic* German Wirehaired Pointer.
